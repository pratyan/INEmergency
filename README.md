The problem INEmergency solves
The problem statement it solves is, "Improvement in Medical Emergencies
with Communication and Coordination". People in a medical emergency can get instant medical assistance through the application with just some simple clicks. The machine learning model will recommend the best possible hospitals on the basis of live patient load data of the hospitals, geographic location, medical facilities, etc. The application will also ensure a confirmed bed and an alert to the hospital prior to the patient's arrival. The whole system is decentralized, which would provide an unbiased recommendation purely upon the live immutable and secured data stored in the blockchain, listed by the respective hospitals. And would also reduce the concepts of paid promotions and advertisements.
